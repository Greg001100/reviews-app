## Reviews Application

This is a simple web application I built, mainly with the purpose of learning the fundamentals of firebase and cloud firestore. It allows the user to leave a review, adds the review to the list of reviews already present, and updates the companies' respective ratings. 

Open [here](https://reviewsapp-94b53.web.app/) to view the live app and play around with writing a review.

**Technologies used:**
- React
- Firebase hosting
- Cloud Firestore
- Bootstrap
